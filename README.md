# Pyrepseq: A python library for immune repertoire analyses

## Installation

Pyrepseq can be installed by obtaining the source code from [Github](https://github.com/andim/pyrepseq) and running `python setup.py install` in the main directory. If you install from source, you first need to install `numpy` and `scipy` if these packages are not already installed.
