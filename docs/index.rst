Pyrepseq: the Swiss army knife of immune repertoire analyses
============================================================

Our adaptive immune system employs an amazingly diverse cast of specific cells to maintain host homeostasis in the face of pathogens and other disturbances. A census of a person's T cells or B cells can be obtained by sequencing the genomic regions coding for the hypervariable receptors of these cells. `pyrepseq`  is a Python library to reveal patterns in the complex datasets resulting from such so-called immune repertoire sequencing.

Pyrepseq aims to be the `scipy` & `seaborn` for studying adaptive immunity: modular implementations of algorithms for fast analyses, and bespoke plotting functions for compelling visualizations.
